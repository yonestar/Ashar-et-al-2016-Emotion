Subject Level

Description:
	id: Unique text identifier for each subject (e.g., subject code)
	names: cell array containing names for each variable in .data and .textdata.
	type: cell array identifying variable type; used to index .data or .textdata.
	      Acceptable values are either 'text' or 'numeric'
	units: cell array identifying units used for each variable (e.g. seconds, count, text)
	descrip: cell array providing detailed description of each variable in .names
	data: cell array, one cell per subject, with rectangular data matrix.
	      Each row is one subject, each column a variable, with names in .names
	      Numeric data only, text data is assigned as NaN
	textdata: cell array, one cell per subject, with cell matrix.
	      Each row is one subject, each column a variable, with names in .names
	      Text data only, numeric data is assigned as ''

	notes on variables:
		<many of the descriptions are wrong! :-/ >
		Exp_pst* refer to an ad hoc self-report q'aire filled out after the intervention
		PANAS was administered before and after both scan sessions
